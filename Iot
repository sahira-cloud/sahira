19. Measure the Distance Using Ultrasonic Sensor and Make Led Blink Using Arduino

Theory

An ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04) measures distance by sending ultrasonic waves and calculating the time taken for the 

echo to return. The formula for distance is:

Distance (cm)=Time (µs)×0.0342\text{Distance (cm)} = \frac{\text{Time (µs)} \times 

0.034}{2}Distance (cm)=2Time (µs)×0.034

In this project:

• An LED blinks when the distance measured by the sensor falls below a threshold.

Components:

1. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):

o TRIG pin: Sends an ultrasonic pulse.

o ECHO pin: Receives the reflected signal.

2. LED: Controlled by a digital pin.

3. Arduino: Processes the sensor data and controls the LED.

CODE:

#define TRIG 9

#define ECHO 10

#define LED 13

void setup() {

 pinMode(TRIG, OUTPUT);

 pinMode(ECHO, INPUT);
pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);

}

void loop() {

 digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW); delayMicroseconds(2);

 digitalWrite(TRIG, HIGH); delayMicroseconds(10); digitalWrite(TRIG, LOW);

 long duration = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH);

 int distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;

 digitalWrite(LED, distance < 10 ? HIGH : LOW); // Blink LED if distance < 10cm

}

Explanation

1. Setup Phase:

o The TRIG pin sends a 10µs pulse.

o The ECHO pin measures the time of the returning pulse.

o The LED is initialized as an output.

2. Loop Phase:

o Distance is calculated from the measured time.

o If the distance is below 10 cm, the LED is turned ON; otherwise, it's OFF.

Proteus Diagram

Components for Simulation:

1. Arduino UNO: Central microcontroller.

2. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:

o TRIG pin → Arduino Pin 9.

o ECHO pin → Arduino Pin 10.

o VCC and GND → Power and ground.

3. LED:

o Anode → Arduino Pin 13 (through a resistor, e.g., 220Ω).

o Cathode → GND.

Steps to Create Diagram:

1. Add an Arduino UNO component.

2. Connect the HC-SR04 TRIG and ECHO pins to pins 9 and 10 of Arduino, respectively.

3. Connect an LED to pin 13 of Arduino, with the cathode connected to GND via a resistor.

4. Provide power to the circuit (5V to the sensor and Arduino)
